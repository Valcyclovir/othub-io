# OTHub

OTHub has long been the community favorite hub to view OriginTrail decentralized network statistics and node earnings. It was the most accessible source for anyone looking to analyze network activity and for node operators to manage their nodes. OTHub-io is the continuation of the original [OTHub](https://github.com/OT-Hub/OTHub) created by [Luke](https://github.com/lukeskinner). 

## Description
OTHub-io wants to bring everything that made OTHub great and add even more features. Not only will OTHub-io bring a detailed view of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph V6 network statistics to all participants, it will also bring personalized dashboards for asset publishers and node runners alike. As part of the plan to expand the utility of OTHub, the platform will also serve as a ground layer for other potential projects to build on top of. For example, OTHub-bot will be a social platform (Telegram, Discord, Twitter) bot that will leverage OTHub-io to allow users to quickly view network statistics and publish assets directly from their respective platforms. The OTHub-api will provide all users direct access to our OriginTrail Parachain database to build any apps desired. 

The following repositories represent the core of OTHub-io:
- OTHub-react: front end for OTHub-io
- OTHub-runtime: back end for OTHub-io
- OTHub-sync: OTP parachain sync
- OTHub-api: API runtime

The following project is the first second layer application to OTHub-io:
- OTHub-bot: multi purpose bot runtime for easy integration to popular social platforms

## Expected impact
Based on the positive feedback gathered from the original OTHub for past versions of the DKG, we expect OTHub-io to have a very significant impact at launch for all participants of the network. A first version of [othub.io](othub.io) is currently available for public viewing with limited functionality and has received very positive community feedbacks.
